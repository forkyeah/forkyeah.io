## What is Fork Yeah!?

Fork Yeah! merges cooking, computer science and activism. If you’re not interested in any of those, you’re in the wrong place. Beat it.

* Fork Yeah! recipes are gluten-free, sugar-free, soy-free and vegan.
* Fork Yeah! recipes are curated to optimize energy stability and boost brain function so you can spend your precious time feeling alert and alive. No more peaks and valleys. No more crash and burn.
* Fork Yeah! recipes are structured for speed and ease of preparation. The directions are written to maximize efficiency and readability without ambiguity.
* Fork Yeah! recipes constitute a functional ecosystem so you won’t have a cupboard full of random ingredients. Collectively, they are organized for maximum return-on-investment.
* Fork Yeah! will teach you how to make a recipe your own and make it better, or, fork it.  
* Fork Yeah! dives into the science of cooking so you can make it an art.

Fork Yeah! will make you smart AF (As Fork).

The idea is to learn to cook, not follow recipes.

Clone the book to your head.

## What is Git?
Cooking is an art and a science. It’s a fundamental skill. It’s not hard. You don’t have to be a rockstar. You just need to know the basics.

Coding is an art and a science. In the 21st century, it’s a fundamental skill. It’s also not hard. You don’t have to be a rockstar. You just need to know the basics.

Git is a version control system. It is most commonly used to develop software.

Say you’re writing a program and you want to test a new feature. You could copy all of your files to a new folder, code the feature, test it, and if you like the result, copy/paste the changes back into the original files.

Or you could use Git.

Git tracks changes in files, allowing you to try new things easily and efficiently without commitment. Doing this is called branching. If you like what you see on the branch, you commit and merge the changes back to the trunk of the tree, or the master.

If you want to modify, improve, or pervert someone else’s project, you fork it, and make it your own.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based version of Git. You can store your files and projects in repositories, or repos. You can browse the projects of other developers and fork or clone them, which means to download it to your computer.

Fork Yeah! uses Github to host its recipes and its website.

## Do You Need to Learn to Code or Use Git?

You don’t have to use Git or learn to code to get the most out of Fork Yeah!

But you’re dually badass if you do.
