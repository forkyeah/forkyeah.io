## What is Fork Yeah!?

## What is Git?
Cooking is an art and a science. It’s a fundamental skill. It’s not hard. You don’t have to be a rockstar. You just need to know the basics.

Coding is an art and a science. In the 21st century, it’s a fundamental skill. It’s also not hard. You don’t have to be a rockstar. You just need to know the basics.

Git is a version control system. It is most commonly used to develop software.

Say you’re writing a program and you want to test a new feature. You could copy all of your files to a new folder, code the feature, test it, and if you like the result, copy/paste the changes back into the original files.

Or you could use Git.

Git tracks changes in files, allowing you to try new things easily and efficiently without commitment. Doing this is called branching. If you like what you see on the branch, you commit and merge the changes back to the trunk of the tree, or the master.

If you want to modify, improve, or pervert someone else’s project, you fork it, and make it your own.

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based version of Git. You can store your files and projects in repositories, or repos. You can browse the projects of other developers and fork or clone them, which means to download it to your computer.

Fork Yeah! uses Github to host its recipes and its website.

## Do You Need to Learn to Code or Use Git?

You don’t have to use Git or learn to code to get the most out of Fork Yeah!

But you’re dually badass if you do.
