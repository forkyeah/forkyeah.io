## Instructions

1. Position rack in middle of oven and pre-heat to 325 degrees F.

2. If itâ€™s not already liquid, melt in a small pan

    * 1/2 C. coconut oil 

3. While oil melts, measure into large bowl: 

    * 1/2 C. maple syrup
    
    * 2 tsp. vanilla
    
    * 1/2 tsp. salt

4. Whisk melted coconut oil into bowl with the syrup, vanilla and salt mixture.

4. Fold into mixture in bowl the following until thoroughly coated:

    * 5 C. oats

    * 2 C. almonds

5. Line baking sheet with parchment paper and spread oat mixture evenly across the baking sheet. Use the spatula to compact the oat mixture. This will ensure large chunks form during baking.

6. Bake 40 minutes, rotating pan once at 20 minutes to ensure even browning.

7. Remove granola from oven and cool to room temperature, then break into chunks and transfer to a container.

8. Stir in:

    * 2 C. raisins.
